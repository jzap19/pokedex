# pokedex

The pokedex project is a project where we use javascript and ajax to call the pokedex api and display the information of the pokenon stats number and moves of the pokemon.

For instance if I called a specific ID tied to a certain pokemon that pokemon stats and abilities will be on display. I used ajax to call the api to pass the information for that pokemon.
